  Project:
  
    -Game with online lobby system, players enter the lobby in groups of 4 or more
    -The game starts with each person (user) starting with 100 points
    -Each round, the players are given the choice to either "help" or "steal" 
    	-If all players "help" then the collective whole is awarded 10 points
    	-If a single player picks "steal" then they get 30 points
    	-If more than 2 players pick "steal" in the same round then they each get deducted 20 points
